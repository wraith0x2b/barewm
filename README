Bare WM - A minimal fullscreen window manager for Linux

Bare WM is a full screen window manager aimed at those who spend their day cycling through windows instead of having 10 onscreen at a time.
It's a dumbed down version of Ratpoison's default behaviour (all windows open in fullscreen, with no ability to resize,just to cycle through).
For people who only use GNU Screen, Firefox  and/or Emacs all day long, it's really useful as it lets you use every free pixel of the screen.
Not sure if this will ever have any type of tiling...I might make it work with some predefined layouts but not sure.

INSTALL

$ tar -xvf barewm-0.2.tar.gz
$ cd barewm-0.2
$ vim conf.h

$ make
$ sudo make install

RUNNING

$ vim ~/.xinitrc
exec xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr -solid "Gray50" &
exec barewm
$ startx

TODO
1. Handle the timeout better.
2. Custom key bindings. Working on implementing message and spawn bindings for now.
   Useful if you want to set bindings to run your own scripts, for example to display system stats or whatnot
   using the built-in messaging system.
3. Maybe (MAYBE!) splitting. Atleast a 2 frame vertical splitting would be in order if I pursue this.
4. Named virtual workspaces
5. < to come >
