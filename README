Bare WM - A minimal fullscreen window manager for Linux

Bare WM is a full screen window manager aimed at those who spend their day cycling through windows instead of having 10 onscreen at a time.
It's a dumbed down version of Ratpoison's default behaviour (all windows open in fullscreen, with no ability to resize,just to cycle through).
For people who only use GNU Screen, Firefox  and/or Emacs all day long, it's really useful as it lets you use every free pixel of the screen.

INSTALL

$ tar -xvf barewm-0.2.tar.gz
$ cd barewm-0.2
$ vim conf.h
< edit settings / keys / colors >
$ make
$ sudo make install

RUNNING

$ vim ~/.xinitrc
exec xsetroot -solid "Gray50" &
exec barewm
$ startx

USAGE
Configuration is done by modifying the conf.h file and recompiling.
The default keybindings are:
- MOD = Left WIN key
- MOD + t : enter command mode
All following keys are issued when in command mode
- c : spawn terminal (defaults to urxvt)
- w : display window list
- q : kill selected window
- m : spawn launcher menu program (by default it uses dmenu)
- p : select previous window
- n : select next window

TODO
1. Handle the timeout better.
2. Custom key bindings. Working on implementing message and spawn bindings for now.
   Useful if you want to set bindings to run your own scripts, for example to display system stats or whatnot
   using the built-in messaging system.
3. Maybe (MAYBE!) splitting. Atleast a 2 frame vertical splitting would be in order if I pursue this.
4. Named virtual workspaces
5. < to come >
